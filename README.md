# Survival Analysis of Cancer Patients Data

This project applies **Survival Analysis techniques** to study cancer patient data and estimate survival probabilities.  
The goal is to understand factors that influence patient survival times and to build predictive models for risk assessment.

---

##  Project Overview
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on cancer survival dataset.
- Apply **Kaplan-Meier estimator** for survival probability estimation.
- Compare survival functions across different patient groups (e.g., age, gender, treatment).
- Use **Cox Proportional Hazards Model** to identify significant predictors of survival.
- Build and evaluate **Machine Learning models** (Random Survival Forests, XGBoost-Survival) for prediction.

##  Methods Used
- **EDA**: Data cleaning, missing value handling, visualization.
- **Survival Analysis**:
  - Kaplan-Meier Estimator
  - Log-rank Test
  - Cox Proportional Hazards Model
- **Machine Learning Approaches**:
  - Random Survival Forests
  - XGBoost for survival prediction
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Concordance Index (C-Index)

##  Results
- Kaplan-Meier curves show clear differences in survival among patient subgroups.
- Cox model highlights significant clinical predictors of survival.
- Machine learning models achieve improved predictive accuracy compared to traditional methods.
- Achieved 0.75 concordance index with Random Survival Forests
